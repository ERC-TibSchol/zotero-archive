    "abstractNote": "This paper is part of a series of articles on the theory of argumentation proposed by the Tibetan thinker Phya pa Chos kyi seng ge (1109-1169), and in particular on his views on argumentation 'by consequence' (Tib. thal 'gyur/thal ba). I examine in detail the sections of Phya pa\u2019s epistemological summary and of his commentary on Dharmak\u012brti\u2019s Pram\u0101\u1e47avini\u015bcaya that deal with the identification and definition of various kinds of consequences: fallacious consequences, genuine consequences and, among the latter, proving consequences and refuting consequences. I highlight the existence of two distinct frameworks in Phya pa\u2019s discussion. In the first, Phya pa exclusively deals with consequences that fulfill a probative function. In the second, more extended framework, he establishes a thirteenfold typology of consequences that also includes consequences that fail to prove the proponent\u2019s thesis but still succeed in refuting the opponent. I examine Phya pa\u2019s criteria for proving consequences, and discuss the specific cases of consequences with a true conclusion and consequences with a true premise. I argue that the juxtaposition of the two frameworks reflects a gradual process of composition in which an earlier model was integrated and updated.",
